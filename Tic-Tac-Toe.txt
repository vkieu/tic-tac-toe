Tic-Tac-Toe

As a player I want to play tic-tac-toe with the computer.

The game:
. two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

How to play:
. when the application starts, asks for the first player (computer or human)
. based on the answer, the application returns with the 3×3 grid, as:

  A B C
1  | | 
  -+-+-
2  | | 
  -+-+-
3  | | 

(if computer starts, than there must be an X in the grids)
. on the console the player can specify his/her next move, like A1, B3, ... The program returns with the grid.
. the computer do the next step, and return with the grid.
. the steps above continue, while one of the players will have three signs in a row, column or diagonal.

No additional, special UI is required (console is enough).

Use your preferred IDE, programming language.
Use GIT as VCS.

Level 1: computer's steps are arbitrary
Level 2: Level 1 + computer's steps are optimal
Level 3: Level 2 + the application exposes an interface, for other programs / players to play the game.
